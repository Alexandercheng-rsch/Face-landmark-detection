This project aims to perform facial landmark detection with a set of diverse images. However the problem is that the model lacked training data. To overcome this, one can artificially increase their datasets through augmentations and concatnating each unique permutation of the augmentation. 
Furthermore, this project uses custom CNN architecture with skip connections to aid with the insufficient data.
